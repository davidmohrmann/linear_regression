# Signs of Regression

The purpose of this assignment was to practice using linear regression with scikit-learn through exercises.

The primary goal was to present a well-organized Jupyter notebook file with charts and data exploring linear relationships in the data.


After completing this assignment, one will be able to use scikit-learn to perform linear regression and understand single and multi-variable linear regression.

The data used for this assignment is included in the folder, linear_regression.
